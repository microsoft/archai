First Time Contributor
======================

We are excited to have you as a contributor to our platform. Most contributions require you to agree to a `Contributor License Agreement (CLA) <https://cla.microsoft.com>`_ declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution.

If this is your first time contributing to Archai, please follow these guidelines:

#. Familiarize yourself with the project's codebase and community guidelines. This can be done by reading through the documentation and exploring the codebase on GitHub.

#. Create a new branch for your changes. This will allow you to easily submit your code as a pull request when you are finished.

#. Follow the project's style guidelines. This may include specific formatting or naming conventions.

#. Test your code thoroughly. This may involve writing unit tests or manually testing the functionality.

#. Document your code. This may include in-line documentation as well as updating relevant documentation files.

#. Submit your code as a pull request. Include a clear and concise description of the changes made and any relevant issue references. When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine if you need to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repositories using our CLA.

#. Be open to feedback and iteration on your code. It is common for pull requests to go through multiple rounds of review before being merged.

We appreciate your contributions and look forward to working with you to continue the impactful progress of Archai as a positive feedback loop between the engineering and research aspects of NAS.
