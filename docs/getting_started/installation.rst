Installation
============

There are various methods to install Archai, but it is recommended to use it within a virtual environment, such as ``conda`` or ``pyenv``. This ensures that the software runs in a consistent and isolated environment, and allows for easy management of installed packages and dependencies.

.. attention::

   Archai requires `Python <http://python.org>`_ 3.7+ and `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org>`_ 1.7.0+.

PyPI
----

PyPI provides a convenient way to install Python packages, as it allows users to easily search for and download packages, as well as automatically handle dependencies and other installation requirements. This is especially useful for larger Python projects that require multiple packages to be installed and managed.

.. code-block:: sh

    pip install archai

The default installation only includes the core functionality of Archai, e.g., NAS-related packages. To install additional functionalities, use the following commands:

* Computer Vision: ``pip install archai[cv]``.
* Natural Language Processing: ``pip install archai[nlp]``.
* Built-in Modules (all modules above): ``pip install archai[all]``.

Source
------

Installing from source ensures that the latest version of the package is used, including any unpublished changes that have not yet been released on PyPI. This allows developers to stay up-to-date with the latest changes, and ensure that their code is compatible with the latest version of the package.

.. tab:: Linux/MacOS

    .. code-block:: sh

        git clone https://github.com/microsoft/archai.git
        cd archai/scripts
        install.sh

.. tab:: Windows

    .. code-block:: bat

        git clone https://github.com/microsoft/archai.git
        cd archai/scripts
        .\install.bat

Docker
------

Docker is a useful tool for running experiments because it provides a consistent, isolated environment for the experiment to run in. This ensures that the results of the experiment are not affected by external factors, such as the specific operating system or installed packages on the host machine.

The :github:`docker/Dockerfile` provides a development environment to run experiments. Additionally, :github:`docker/build_image.sh` and :github:`docker/run_container.sh` provide scripts to build the image and run the container, respectively:

.. code-block:: sh

    cd docker
    bash build_image.sh
    bash run_container.sh
