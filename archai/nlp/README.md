# Natural Language Processing with Archai

Natural Language Processing (NLP) models take advantage of hardware advancements to solve more complex tasks. Nevertheless, such advancements also lead to an increased number of parameters, raising concerns regarding production-ready environments and low-resource devices.

Archai provides a straightforward alternative to find more efficient models through Neural Architecture Search (NAS), furnishing an ideal place to prototype and implement autoregressive transformer-based architectures. Essentially, the idea is to keep everything simple while offering developers and researchers every single tool to fulfill their needs.

Use NLP with Archai if you need a package or wish to:

* Fast-experiment transformer-based architectures;
* Design or use pre-loaded language modeling tasks;
* Increase your efficiency without losing effectiveness;
* Find new architectures under certain constraints.
