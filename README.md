# Archai: Platform for Neural Architecture Search

[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/microsoft/archai)](https://github.com/microsoft/archai/blob/main/LICENSE)
[![Issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/microsoft/archai)](https://github.com/microsoft/archai/issues)
[![Latest release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/microsoft/archai)](https://github.com/microsoft/archai/releases)

**Archai** is a Neural Network Search (NAS) platform that allows you to generate efficient deep networks for your applications. It offers the following advantages:

* ðŸ”¬ Easy mix-and-match between different algorithms;
* ðŸ“ˆ Self-documented hyper-parameters and fair comparison;
* âš¡ Extensible and modular to allow rapid experimentation;
* ðŸ“‚ Powerful configuration system and easy-to-use tools.

Please refer to the [documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/archai) for more information.

Package compatibility: **Python 3.7+** and **PyTorch 1.2.0+**.
OS compatibility: **Windows**, **Linux** and **MacOS**.

## Quickstart

### Installation

There are many alternatives to installing Archai, but note that regardless of choice, we recommend using it within a virtual environment, such as `conda` or `pyenv`.

#### PyPI

PyPI provides a fantastic source of ready-to-go packages, and it is the easiest way to install a new package:

```terminal
pip install archai
```

#### Source (development)

Alternatively, one can clone this repository and install the bleeding-edge version:

```terminal
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/archai.git
cd archai
install.sh # on Windows, use install.bat
```

Please refer to the [installation guide](https://microsoft.github.io/archai/getting-started/install.html) for more information.

### Running an Algorithm

To run a specific NAS algorithm, specify it by the `--algos` switch:

```terminal
python scripts/main.py --algos darts --full
```

Please refer to [running algorithms](https://microsoft.github.io/archai/user-guide/tutorial.html#running-existing-algorithms) for more information on available switches and algorithms.

### Tutorials

The best way to familiarize yourself with Archai is to take a quick tour through our [30-minute tutorial](https://microsoft.github.io/archai/user-guide/tutorial.html). Additionally, one can dive into the [Petridish tutorial](https://microsoft.github.io/archai/user-guide/petridish.html) developed at Microsoft Research and available at Archai.

We highly recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) to take advantage of predefined run configurations and interactive debugging. From the `archai` directory, launch Visual Studio Code, select **Run** (Ctrl+Shift+D), choose the configuration and click on **Play**.

On the other hand, you can use [Archai on Azure](tools/azure/README.md) to run NAS experiments at scale.
